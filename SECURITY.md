## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of MDPreview seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/kazu-42/mdpreview/security/advisories) page
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill in the details of the vulnerability

Alternatively, you can email the maintainer directly at the address listed in the GitHub profile.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, XSS, code injection)
- Full path of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability and how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity, typically within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow [coordinated vulnerability disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure)
- We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before publishing it
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

Thank you for helping keep MDPreview and our users safe!
